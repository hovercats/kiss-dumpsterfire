# kiss-dumpsterfire

This is my personal KISS-repo, for stuff I enjoy using or experimenting with.
It consist of mostly statically linked packages, but not everything (although, if
it were up to me, it would).
I also chose to stay with using `libressl`, aswell as `xorg`. 
Wayland however is on my todo list, but this will come whenever. 

Have a look at #2, for the state of building things statically.
Its also worth mentioning that building things statically will more often than
not, break parts of your system. 
If your coming from a fully working enviroment, be carefull about what you
build statically, as you may end up breaking more than you wish for. 
A perfect example of this is if you try to build zlib statically. 

If any issues arise, or you have any suggestions or ideas youd wish to share, feel free to
open up a PR or an issue, and we'll see what we can do.
