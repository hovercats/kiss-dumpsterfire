# kiss-dumpsterfire


Just a repo with some packages that I use or experiment with. 

Currently depends on [kiss' main repo](https://github.com/kiss-community/repo-main) and [community](https://github.com/kiss-community/repo-community) repo.
Some of the buildscripts might not work, so you may have to build them yourself from git instead. hence the name of the repo. If that is the case, it should be stated below in package description. 


Current packages:
- Brightnessctl
	- Just controls your screen brightness. as simple as that.
- Devour
	- Basiclly a swallow utility, like DWM swallow patch, but its WM independent.
- Dmenu
	- Luke Smith's fork of Dmenu
- Glazier
	- Really minimal WM
- Libwm
	- dependency

	- My personal build of st
