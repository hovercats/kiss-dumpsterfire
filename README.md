This here's My personal repo, which I use to acompany my [Kiss-somethingsomethingstatic](https://github.com/hovercats/kiss-somethingsomethingstatic).

I usually put packages that I dont feel like fits into the other repo, aswell as
forks with my own personal touches on them. i.e. patches for st. 
Similarly to Kiss-somethingsomethingstatic, packages here is statically
linked. However, they might aswell not be too.
Check buildscript in any case, for more details.
