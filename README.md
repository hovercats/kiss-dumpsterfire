# kiss-dumpsterfire


Just a repo of some of the packages that I use, and experiment with.

Currently depends on [kiss' main repo](https://github.com/kiss-community/repo-main) and [community](https://github.com/kiss-community/repo-community) repo.
Some of the buildscripts might not work, so you may have to build them yourself from git instead. hence the name of the repo.


Current packages:
- Brightnessctl
	- Just controls your screen brightness. as simple as that.
- Devour
	- Basiclly a swallow utility, like DWM swallow patch, but its WM independent.
	- buildscript is a bit finnicky atm
	- requires root priviligies to build, for some reason.
- Dmenu
	- Luke Smith's fork of Dmenu
- Glazier
	- Really minimal WM
	- Buildscript ~~is currently broken~~ now works
- Libwm
	- dependency
- ST
	- My personal build of st
- wmutils
	- really neat utility for manipulating x11 windows.
	- can be used standalone, or in conjuction with glazier, sowm or w/e
- wmutils-opt
	- addon for wmutils, for mouse support and reading x events
- meh
	- simple image viewer
	- lets you view images cropped down, instead of always fullsize lik feh
- eiwd
	- iwd withot dbus
	- uses illiliti's fork, as dylan's is no longer maintained.
