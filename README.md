A personal KISS repository, which I use to acompany my 
[kiss-somethingsomethingstatic](https://github.com/hovercats/kiss-somethingsomethingstatic).

At this moment, theres not too much to say. Both this repo, aswell as the
afforementioned repo, is undergoing alot of changes. I will be adding more stuff
here, but at a later point, once I get more finalized on alot of stuff thats
currently going on.
