kiss-dumpsterfire
-----------------

This is my personal kiss-repo.

It has several differences to upstream.
Some key notes:
	- init scripts written in rc
	- busybox's init has been replaced by rcinit[0]
	- rcsm[1] instead of busybox's runit
	- prefer static linking whereever possible
	- sbase/ubase instead of busybox
	- libressl instead of openssl
	- pax instead of tar
	- tinyx instead of wayland or xorg-server
