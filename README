Kiss-dumpsterfire 
________________________________________________________________________________

A personal KISS repository, which now serves as a testing ground for 
KISS-somethingsomethingstatic[0], and as you probably guessed, its statically 
linked.


Overview
________________________________________________________________________________

This repository is highly experimental, and is not to be considered a viable
option for daily usage.
It also contains some changes perhaps unique to my system, which may or may not
work for you (I.e. I run amd, therefore I dont need intel/nvidia related stuff).

Appart from that, not everything in this repo is building statically, hence the
above infomation. Refer to buildscripts and commitlogs for more info.
