Core
______________________________________________________________________________

Core contains, you guessed it, core packages. 
There are however changes as opposed to vanilla KISS:

* Byacc over Bison
* Bsd-M4, over GNU-M4
* Libressl over openssl
* LLVM over gcc/binutils <-- this is WIP. Im still figuring some things out.

Gnu-m4 and bison is however still available extra, so both are still optional.
Openssl is currently not yet packaged.

There is also no grub, or efibootmgr for that matter in extra.
Instead we create our own boot entries, in /efi, and your bios/uefi.

Note: if dualbooting, do the same with the other OS(s) aswell.

Heres a quick how-to:
* create /efi (this may not be strictly neccessary, but this is what I use.)
* compile your kernel
* copy arch/x86_86/boot/BzImage -> /efi/bootx64.efi
* reboot into your bios/uefi
* find the section where you can create your own trusted boot entries
* find and select your bootx64.efi file
* profit.

When upgrading your kernel, create a backup of your bootx64.efi file, and create
a boot entry for that aswell, so youd always have an older kernel to boot back
into.
