Core
______________________________________________________________________________

Core contains, you guessed it, core packages. 
There are however changes as opposed to vanilla KISS:

* Byacc over Bison
* Bsd-M4, over GNU-M4
* Libressl over openssl

Gnu-m4 and bison is however still available, but in extra, instead of core.
Openssl is currently not packaged.

There is also no grub, or efibootmgr for that matter in extra.
Instead we create our own boot entries, in /efi, and your bios/uefi.

Heres a quick guide on how:
* create /efi (this may not be strictly neccessary.)
* compile your kernel
* copy arch/x86_86/boot/BzImage -> /efi/bootx64.efi
* reboot into your bios/uefi
* find the section where you can create your own trusted boot entries
* find and select your bootx64.efi file
* profit.

When upgrading your kernel, just copy your bootx64.efi to a backup file in /efi,
before copying over the new kernel, now as bootx64-fallback.efi. 
remember to create a boot entry for your bootx64-backup.efi aswell, so youd
always have a backup of your previous kernel.
